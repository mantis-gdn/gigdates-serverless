        <h2>Hollow Drift</h2>
        <p>
            Born from the same spirit that powers Gigdates.net, <strong>Hollow Drift</strong> is more than a music project ‚Äî it's a voice for the voiceless, 
            a raw fusion of emotion, rebellion, and generative art.
        </p>
        <p>
            Created by Mantis, the founder of Gigdates, Hollow Drift explores genres like industrial metal, post-hardcore, and cyberpunk soundscapes, 
            channeling real-life struggles into audio experiences. Every track tells a story ‚Äî of addiction, resilience, recovery, and reinvention.
        </p>
        <p>
            Hollow Drift is proof that even after silence, the music still speaks.
