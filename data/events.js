  "review": "BallzNight Live at The Met RI on January 18, 2025, was an unforgettable experience featuring tribute performances by Korn Ballz, Limp Ballz, and Beastie Ballz. The show kicked off with palpable energy as Limp Ballz wrapped up their sound check. After paying the $20 cover charge, I reconnected with Missy, one of the venue’s managers, who remembered me from our previous Facebook messages. I also introduced myself to the house sound engineer, handing him a business card for gigdates.net during a brief chat. Limp Ballz brought incredible energy to the stage, with their performance of ‘Take A Look Around’ standing out. The breakdown and drop pulled me in completely, and I found myself moving to the music, walking and jumping in front of the stage, even clutching my glasses to keep them secure. Despite being almost in my senior years, I felt like the one-man mosh pit, drawing attention as the singer gave me a fist bump mid-performance. Representing gigdates.net as “Mantis,” I believe I made a lasting impression. The intensity of the night eventually led me to step away halfway through the show, but the raw energy and connection I felt will stay with me for years to come."
